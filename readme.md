# About the app
* Eatwise App is created to provide basic health monitoring. The amount of
calorie a person consumes in a day is calculated just by clicking the photo
with help of the smart phone. We are implementing AI based vision
technology and image processing for this project. The model can identify
various foods and calculates the calories considering their size with around
94% accuracy.
* __APK file is in the root folder__
